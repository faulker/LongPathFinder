LongPathFinder
========

I created LongPathFinder to track down folders and files that had paths or names that were longer then Windows officially supported.
LongPathFinder will search a directory and when it comes accross and path that is to longer or a file/folder name that is to long it will spit out a message about it.

***

**Usage**: LongPathFinder.exe [folder you want to search]

***

Requires Microsoft .NET Framework 2
